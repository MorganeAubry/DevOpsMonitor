# DevOpsMonitor

## Project Overview

**DevOpsMonitor** is a comprehensive platform for incident management, monitoring, and alerting, designed to improve the reliability and efficiency of operations in a DevOps environment. The platform integrates multiple DevOps practices and technologies, enabling real-time incident detection, automated monitoring, and seamless incident management.

This project is built to help DevOps practitioners enhance their skills by developing, deploying, and securing a full-stack platform that monitors infrastructure, handles incidents, and provides detailed reports on system performance.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Using WebSocket and agent-based monitoring, the platform detects incidents and provides immediate alerts.
- **Incident Management**: Centralized dashboard for managing and tracking incidents in real-time.
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: Leveraging tools like Terraform and Ansible for automated infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrated with Jenkins and Git to automate code testing, building, and deployment.
- **Security**: The platform ensures secure storage and management of sensitive data using technologies like **HashiCorp Vault**, encryption methods, and HTTPS protocols.
- **Scalability**: Orchestrated using Docker and Kubernetes, allowing the platform to scale as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Version Control & CI/CD**: Git, Jenkins
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **WebSocket Communication**: WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL (with encryption)
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault, SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

## Project Structure

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and provision the infrastructure using Terraform and configure it with Ansible.
2. **Monitoring**: Collect and visualize system metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
3. **WebSocket Agent**: Develop a WebSocket-based agent to track and report incidents in real-time.
4. **Incident Management**: Develop a dashboard for incident tracking, including detailed reports and alerts.
5. **Database Security**: Implement secure database management, including encryption of sensitive information and user authentication.
6. **Scalability**: Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration to ensure a scalable and reliable platform.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Minikube or cloud-based cluster)
- Terraform and Ansible
- PostgreSQL/MySQL database
- Prometheus and Grafana
- Node.js (for WebSocket agents)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DevOpsMonitor.git
   cd DevOpsMonitor
   ```
2. **Set up infrastructure with Teraform**
   
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Provision servers with Ansible:

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml
   ```
6. Build and deploy the platform with Docker:
   
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
8. Run Kubernetes Pods (if using Kubernetes):
   
   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```
10. Access the monitoring dashboard:
Open the Grafana and Prometheus dashboards to view metrics and incidents.

Future Enhancements
Add more detailed metrics and health checks.
Enhance alerting with multiple notification channels (Slack, Email, etc.).
Integrate machine learning for predictive incident detection.
Implement user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).

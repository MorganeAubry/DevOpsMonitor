# DevOpsMonitor

## Project Overview

**DevOpsMonitor** is a comprehensive platform for incident management, monitoring, and alerting, designed to improve the reliability and efficiency of operations in a DevOps environment. The platform integrates multiple DevOps practices and technologies, enabling real-time incident detection, automated monitoring, and seamless incident management.

This project is built to help DevOps practitioners enhance their skills by developing, deploying, and securing a full-stack platform that monitors infrastructure, handles incidents, and provides detailed reports on system performance.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Using WebSocket and agent-based monitoring, the platform detects incidents and provides immediate alerts.
- **Incident Management**: Centralized dashboard for managing and tracking incidents in real-time.
- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: Leveraging tools like Terraform and Ansible for automated infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrated with Jenkins and Git to automate code testing, building, and deployment.
- **Security**: The platform ensures secure storage and management of sensitive data using technologies like **HashiCorp Vault**, encryption methods, and HTTPS protocols.
- **Scalability**: Orchestrated using Docker and Kubernetes, allowing the platform to scale as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Version Control & CI/CD**: Git, Jenkins
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **WebSocket Communication**: WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL (with encryption)
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Security**: HashiCorp Vault, SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

## Project Structure

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and provision the infrastructure using Terraform and configure it with Ansible.
2. **Monitoring**: Collect and visualize system metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
3. **WebSocket Agent**: Develop a WebSocket-based agent to track and report incidents in real-time.
4. **Incident Management**: Develop a dashboard for incident tracking, including detailed reports and alerts.
5. **Database Security**: Implement secure database management, including encryption of sensitive information and user authentication.
6. **Scalability**: Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration to ensure a scalable and reliable platform.
